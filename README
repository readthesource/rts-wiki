# Read The Source (RTS) Guidelines

## Guest Presenters
Guest Presenters are usually core developers or owners of an open source project but they can also be coders that use the project and know it well enough to present code and help viewers understand what the code is doing at given points. 

RTS distributes content through our YouTube Channel, rss feed, iTunes, and other media channels that are free of charge for users. No one is, or ever will be, charged for standard RTS episodes. We are dedicated to helping software developers understand the technologies we use to build software in the 21st century.

Guest Presentors are expected to deliver quality video that viewers can easily consume through our video channel. This means we need a few guidelines and rules in order to effectively deliver this content.

### Our Story
Christian Smith, founder & CEO of Anvil Research, & Erik Isaksen, Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies, met on LinkedIn forums answering and asking several questions about Node.js & several JavaScript frameworks like Angular.js. Christian and Erik started pair programming on Angular projects and noted several problems they were having in their code at the framework level. 

Christian & Erik decided to step through the Angular source code in the developer tools to find out what was happening. After the issues were resolved, they realized that other developers also had similar issues and could benefit by a live walkthrough of the code. Before long the two had a monthly meeting with several other developers where they took pieces of existing codebases and walked through the code step by step. 

### Preparing a RTS Presentation
A few key factors go into making a great presentation for RTS. First, we need to find code in the open source project that could be discussed in detail over the course of 45 minutes to an hour. Remember that this is a visual & auditory experience and quickly running through code without explanation can be frustrating. 

Additionally, the code shown on RTS should have a beginning, middle, and end. Think of it as storytelling; you are are guiding viewers through an onboarding anatomy of a piece of code. What does that code do? Where does it do it? How does it do it? Why does it do it? Every codebase has a story. What is that story? Know your codebase & it's story.

#### RTS Preparation Details
- Create an outline for what you are going to talk about
- Use a simple slide deck with 10 or fewer slides
- Create and demo working code examples (we recommend prerecording these as animated gifs or video)
- Plan out timing for slides & code transitions
- Communicate with the RTS team so they know what they should ask an- Communicate with the RTS team so they know what they should ask an- Communicate with the RTS team so they know what they should ask an- Communicate with the RTS team so they know what they should ask an- Communicate with the RTS team so they know what they should ask an- Communicate with the RTS team so they know lems
- find a quiet place to sit down
- do not use the computer speakers to avoid feedback
